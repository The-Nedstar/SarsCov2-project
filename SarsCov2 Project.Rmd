## 2.

Both datasets show very similar trajectories. When the count is increasing they are almost identical, starting at about the same time and growing at similar rates. They both peak at about the same time as well. However, the decrease in count after the peak is different for the ONS-CIS data taking substantially longer and having a more gradual curvature compared to the COG-UK data which has a sudden and more linear drop off.

The most likely cause for this discrepancy is the difference in sampling techniques. COG-UK data was taken from PCR testing, wherase ONS-CIS used random samples from the population. Many people would test positive for the strain long after it was causing symptoms. On top of this, people were likely to get tested early on into their infection, with a long period afterwards in which it could still be tested. Therefore, random testing of individuals is likely to pick up their infection later into it's cycle and lead to the delayed drop that we see.

### i.

The West Midlands had the fastest outbreak with an S of 0.1751.

The North West had the earliest rise in frequencies with an F0 of 0.537.

Difference in time of rise was likely caused by the connections of Locations to each other and do locations outside of England. Locations with large airports for instance are likely candidates for entry of a new strain into the country. Speed of outbreak will be determined by many conditions, including both the movement of people, but also the sucseptibility of the population. Potentially there are greater proportions of young and elderly people in the West Midlands, or a greater proportion of people who had not been exposed to any form of Covid before.

### ii.

The founder's effect is when a small selection of the total disease population enters a new separated host population, such as a geographical area. This small selection has only a fraction of the genetic diversity of the larger population and so all people infected by it will be infected by genetically similar strains. When using Logistic growth models this can lead to an increased S compared to situations where the founder's effect is not occuring.

The data from our analysis supports the conclusion that the founder's effect is leading to differences in growth across different regions, we see a large variety in S values from 0.9 to 1.75 (almost a 2 fold difference) meaning that the rate of growth is almost twice as fast in some areas compared to others. This is good evidence that a founder's effect style interaction is occuring to lead to this discrepancy.
